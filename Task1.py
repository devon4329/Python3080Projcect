"""
CS3080 Project - Task 1
This program will scrape a website,
https://www.ef.edu/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-1000-words/, for the top 1000
English words. The program will take these words and put them into an Excel sheet. This Excel
sheet will then be used as input to create a hangman-like word game where the user has a limited
number of guesses to guess each letter in the random word out of the Excel sheet.
